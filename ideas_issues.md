  -  ATTRACTION TO COUNTRY CASCADE POSSIBLE?
As attraction is the lowest item on my database, is there a way to add a new attraction that then fills in the city table & country table?
XX Workable but not ideal solution is to copy add new country & city links to new pages.

COMPLETE/RESOLVED

  -  ADD LINKS TO SHOW PAGES, I.E. CLICK ON WORD RATHER THAN LINK

  -  !!!ATTRACTION EDIT NOT GOING TO UPDATE PAGE - WHY?
  It goes to create page instead because in the edit page I wasn't sending to"/countries/<%=@attraction.id%>"!
