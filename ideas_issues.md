  -  !!!ADD SEARCH FOR DESTINATION BY LANGUAGE, ATTRACTION_TYPE, CITY OR COUNTRY

  -  !!!PRESENT INFORMATION IN GOOD FORMAT - CSS FLEX?

  -  ADD CSS!

  -  !!!WHEN ADD NEW COUNTRY - DOES NOT HAVE LANGUAGES SPOKEN - HOW TO DO THIS?

Somehow get the city id in link?

  -  ADD DELETE FOR ALL MODELS?

  -  HOW TO MAKE GRAMMATICAL TEXT FOR 1 VS >1
I.e. home index: "there are still 1 countries on my bucketlist!"

  -  ATTRACTION TO COUNTRY CASCADE POSSIBLE?
As attraction is the lowest item on my database, is there a way to add a new attraction that then fills in the city table & country table?
XX Workable but not ideal solution is to copy add new country & city links to new pages.

  -  ADD ATTRACTION TYPE TO TABLES, MODELS






COMPLETE/RESOLVED

  -  ADD LINKS TO SHOW PAGES, I.E. CLICK ON WORD RATHER THAN LINK

  -  !!!ATTRACTION EDIT NOT GOING TO UPDATE PAGE - WHY?
  It goes to create page instead because in the edit page I wasn't sending to"/countries/<%=@attraction.id%>"!

  -  !!!ADD IN NAME OF COUNTRY TO CITY INDEX USING .COUNTRY METHOD!
  I thought it returned a hash but it was actually a class object - use .name

  -  ADD LANGUAGES SPOKEN COUNT TO APP HOME

  -  ADD LANGUAGES AND INTEGRATE WITH COUNTRY

  -  UPDATE SEEDS WITH MORE INFO TO DEMONSTRATE MANY TO MANY
