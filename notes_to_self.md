I keep finding that something isn't working but later after doing some other unrelated stuff (or so I think), it suddenly rights itself and works. I.e. my edit view for countries.

Wanted to create an attraction_type but this was going to practice same skills - one to many - I wanted to utilise my time to implement and practice a different skill so prioritised introducing languages.
