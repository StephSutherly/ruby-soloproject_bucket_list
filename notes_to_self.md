I keep finding that something isn't working but later after doing some other unrelated stuff (or so I think), it suddenly rights itself and works. I.e. my edit view for countries.

Wanted to create an attraction_type but this was going to practice same skills - one to many - I wanted to utilise my time to implement and practice a different skill so prioritised introducing languages.

Very easy to get distracted like when cleaning flat, start in one room then take something to another room and get distracted there. I.e. when integrating language model - kept getting distracted by amending links or text on a page.
